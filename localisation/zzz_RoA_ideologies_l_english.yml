conservatism_desc:0 "For many political figures in recent years, a belief exists that the petty squabbling of Senators and archaic administrative organisation of the Republic have led to a great malaise, one that only a strong, dynamic government with bold reforms could treat. These anti-corruption, centralist ideas gave birth to the Centrist movement. Since it's explosion onto the scene under the tutelage of the late Chommel Senator Sheev Palpatine, Centrism has gone from strength to strength, informing the Chancellorships of Andrian Dansion and Nikolai Vesnek, however the maturation of the ideology has led to increasing splintering and infighting within it. Today, Centrism can be divided into three broad ideological currents. On the right are the predominant Pangalactic Centrists, a collection of culturally conservative and centralist politicians who follow traditions laid down by Palpatine and who are the most vocally radical in their centralist rhetoric. Proactivists, as informed by Chancellor Andrian Dansion, make up the literal centre of the Centrists. They are politically pragmatic and flexible, holding generally paternalist viewpoints but open to compromise to achieve their main goal: the mobilisation of a Grand Army of the Republic. From the Proactivists have emerged a third group, the more left-wing Integralist Centrists. The brainchild of Sirona Kuat, the Integralists can be considered a blend of Centrist principles with Populist social policies as part of her "Integral" nationalism model. Integralists champion centralisation, but are also culturally progressive, xenophilic and support strong welfare programmes."
